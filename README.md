## Development

The site is built with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, focusing on simplicity and performance. The design features:

- Rainbow gradient animations
- Responsive layout
- Interactive hover effects
- Mobile-first approach

### Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
# or
pnpm preview
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

Build and run the container:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t krauss-haus -f docker/Dockerfile .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:80 krauss-haus
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Image Generation

Images have been generated with ChatGPT. All cocktail images typically follow the following prompt template:

> Create an artistic painting of a `name` cocktail in a `type of glass` with `type of ice`, `and any garnishes or other visual details`. Use loose brushstrokes and an expressive watercolor style with `color` tones. Make this a completely transparent PNG with no background at all, although minor abstract background directly behind the cocktail is okay as long as it highlights the cocktail itself. The illustration should have a hand-painted artistic interpretation with clear edges and a contained design. Portrait orientation (taller than wide).

An example prompt is:

```
Create an artistic painting of a jet pilot cocktail in a rocks glass with crushed ice, a speared maraschino cherry on a cocktail pick (no other garnish), and a straw. Use loose brushstrokes and an expressive watercolor style with translucent light brown tones. Make this a completely transparent PNG with no background at all, although minor abstract background directly behind the cocktail is okay as long as it highlights the cocktail itself. The illustration should have a hand-painted artistic interpretation with clear edges and a contained design. Portrait orientation (taller than wide).
```
